Web map styling with YSLD
=========================

YSLD is the styling language used for maps served with OpenGeo Suite. It is designed to be equivalent in functionality to Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD), a serialization markup language also used by GeoServer, while providing a much simpler markup. In fact, it runs on the same internal engine, and so isn't a "converted" language like the CSS Styling extension for GeoServer and OpenGeo Suite.

This section will discuss using YSLD in OpenGeo Suite.

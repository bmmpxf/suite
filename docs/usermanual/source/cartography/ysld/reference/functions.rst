Functions
=========

Functions are additional operations that can be employed when calculating values for YSLD parameters. In most cases, a value for a parameter can be the output (result) of a function.

Syntax
------

Functions aren't a parameter to itself, but instead are used as a part of the values of a parameter. So the syntax is very general::

  <parameter>: <function>


Functions are evaluated at rendering time, so the output is passed as the parameter value and then rendered accordingly.
